Please read the HANDOFF.md file in this project directory and continue the work session from where it left off. This file contains complete context about:

- The project's purpose and current state
- What was accomplished in the previous session
- Outstanding tasks and next steps
- Technical decisions and implementation details
- Files that were modified and why

After reading HANDOFF.md, please:

1. Confirm you understand the project context and current status
2. Summarize the key points and next steps
3. List all outstanding tasks with their priorities
4. Ask which tasks you'd like me to work on, if any
5. Ask any clarifying questions if needed

Treat this as a seamless continuation of the previous session - all the context you need should be in the handoff file.
